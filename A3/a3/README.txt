To switch between two kinds of motion: pressing "X" or "Y"
1. "X" motion - we could control dragon's head angle (rotateY), body angle (vertical / rotateZ), neck can move/rotate when dragon's head moving.
2. "Y" motion - we could control dragon's flying direction (rotateY), tail now can move in the animation.

In "X" motion, pressing "R" could accelerate the animation; pressing "O" would reset the animation (currTime = 0)

Q(a) is implemented in a3.js; Q(b)-Q(e) is implemented in a3-dragon.js
